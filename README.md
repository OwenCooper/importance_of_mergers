Python code for my Part III project, "The importance of mergers in galaxy formation":

A. parameters.py obtains the parameters for the 100 cMpc / h FABLE simulation.
B. galaxy_num_and_redshift.py plots the galaxy number and redshift as a function of time.
C. sfr_smf_halo_mass.py plots star formation rate as a function of stellar mass (fitted to a power law) and stellar mass as a function of halo mass (fitted to a broken power law).
D. merger_rate_pair_fraction.py plots merger rate and pair fraction as a function of time and eachother.  This code also determines characteristic merger time as a function of the age of the universe.
E. ex_situ.py plots the ex situ stellar mass fraction of a random sample of 20 galaxies as a function of time.
